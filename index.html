        <h3>The Rules</h3>
        <p>There are two lifeforms in this Game Of Life simulation; wolves and rabbits. With each tick of simulation the animals have the possibility of breeding or dying. </p>
        <p>The simulation starts with a preset number of Wolves and Rabbits being populated in a random place on the map.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Any life form will die if they are alone as with under population </li>
          
          <li>An animal will die if it is surrounded by more than 3 others as with over population.</li>

          <li>If an animal is in close proximity to a animal of the same species there is a chance they will breed.</li>
        </ol>

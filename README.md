## Game of Life
### A Simulation

There are two lifeforms in this Game Of Life simulation; wolves and rabbits. With each tick of simulation the animals have the possibility of breeding or dying. Currently no one eats anyone else.

The simulation starts with a preset number of Wolves and Rabbits being populated in a random place on the map.

Any life form will die if they are alone as with under population.

An animal will die if it is surrounded by more than 3 others as with over population.

If an animal is in close proximity to a animal of the same species there is a chance they will breed.
